## 0.4.0 - 2016-04-15
* To get the latest copy, run git-merge after git-fetch origin

## 0.3.0 - 2016-03-16
* Condensed two scripts (git-staging and git-production) into one (git-build)
* Added environment option (-e), which defaults to staging
* Fully automated merging and rebasing. In case of conflict:
  * Aborts operation and cleans up for the current branch ONLY.
  * Alerts build master of failure.
  * Proceeds with other branches.
  * At the end of the build process, displays a summary of conflicts detected.
* Moved operations that touch on remote origin to one of two places:
  * At the start of the script, git-fetch origin, done automatically.
  * At the end of the script, git-push XXX, displayed by the script but executed manually by build master (just in case any conflicts are detected)
* Also displays cleanup commands for the local repository.

## 0.2.0 - 2016-03-07
